Gossip attempts to solve the Multicast problem.

## Multicast

Suppose there are a number of nodes which need to be able to talk to each other (send and receive messages) which are essentially processes on some computer connected to the internet or on the network.
A multicast sender sends a message to a number of nodes in the network (but not all, that is broadcast).
The two requirements for Multicast are:

1. Fault tolerance. All non faulty recipients should receive the multicast.
   1. Nodes may crash
   2. Packets may be lost or delayed indefinitely
2. Scalability

The multicast protocol (executed at both Tx and Rx) sits at the application level. Some protocols may talk to the underlying network protocols like IP Multicast.

One way to send multicast messages is to use a `for-loop` and iterate over all the recipient nodes and send TCP or UDP packets to them. But it quickly grows in O(N).

One way to deal with it is to use a tree based approach by developing a spanning tree among the nodes. If the tree is balanced, the height of the tree is logN and max latency to any node is O(logN) which is much better than O(N). This way the overhead for each node is also almost constant. Receive one copy of the message, and send it out to all your children. The drawback is that if any node fails, all it's descendant nodes in the system may never receive the messages. Now we'll have to continuously spend time and bandwidth to repair and maintain the tree. The receivers send ACK messages when they successfully receive messages and NACK to repair the trees.

For example, the SRM protocol send NACK messages when it hasn't received messages it's expecting or generally in some time. When these NACKs are received, the nodes closer to the root send the latest multicasts they have or missing multicasts. To prevent NACK storms NACKs are sent with random delays and exponential backoff.

The other example is RMTP. It uses ACKs instead of NACKs. Receivers send a single ACK for multiple messages they have received together, and if ACKs for any messages are missing, those messages are resent to the receiver. To avoid ACK storms, the receivers send ACKs only to designated receivers.

Both the above examples run in O(N) time complexity.

## Gossip Protocol

Suppose the system has N nodes, and consider one multicast sender with one multicast message, and we want to send the message to all the nodes in the group. Every `t` units of time, periodically, the sender picks `b`(gossip fan out; common value = 2) random targets and sends them the message (called the gossip message) usually using UDP. These nodes are picked with replacement. Once a node receives a gossip, it is said to be infected by the gossip. Now each receiver acts as a sender and sends copies of the message with the same parameters, `b` and `t`. This way there may be nodes that receive multiple duplicate messages. Eventually all nodes receive the message. In a real system the nodes are running the gossip periods independently of each but for analysis we may assume they are synchronised.

The above described gossip protocol is called the **Push Gossip Protocol**. Each node can gossip each message individually or a set of messages together, or other schemes like recency or priority can also be used.

The other kind of gossip protocol is **Pull Gossip Protocol**. In this variant of the Gossip protocol, instead of receiving gossip messages from sender, nodes send out gossips all the time which don't always contain messages but queries for messages that may have been received since the last gossip.

Hybrid variants also do exist of the above two protocols.

### Push Based Gossip Analysis

Analysis is based on Epidemiology. Say there are $n+1$ individuals (nodes) mixing homogeneously. Contact rate per unit time is $\beta$ (typically between 0 and 1) (probability that two individuals will come in contact within the given time period). $x$ is the number of uninfected and $y$ is the number of infected individuals. Initially $x_0 = n$ and $y_0 = 1$ and $x + y = n + 1$. Any contact between infected and uninfected nodes, makes the uninfected node infected. This is a continuous time process and $dx/dt = -\beta xy$. The solution is as follows:

We notice that as $t-> \infty$, the gossip converges and $x$ tends to 0 and $y$ tends to $n+1$.

We take the value of $\beta = b/n$. Consider an uninfected node, and an infected node. The probability that this infected node takes this uninfected node as target is $\beta$. Now the number of infected nodes at time $t = clog(n)$ is $y = (n + 1) - 1/(n^{cb-2})$. Now say we picked the gossip fanout $b = 2$, and set $c$ to some small number, we see that the expression is of the order $1/n^2$ and as $n$ increases, the number goes quickly to zero and we can say that gossip converges in $log(n)$ order of rounds.

Setting $c$ and $b$ to be small numbers independent of $n$, we ensure that within only $clog(n)$ rounds (**low latency**) almost all the nodes receive the message (**reliability**) and in the worst case, a node has sent out $c*b*log(n)$ gossip messages (**lightweight**) (overhead for each node is also logarithmic).

Now suppose 50% of the packets get lost. Now we can simply replace $b$ by $b/2$ and carry on the analysis since the nodes are selected at random, and the packet losses would be uniform across the network. And we can see that now we only need to wait for $2clog(n)$ rounds for the entire network to get infected.

Now if we take node failure to be 50% we can again simply replace $n$ by $n/2$ and $b$ by $b/2$ (this because half of the gossips are sent to failed nodes), and carry on the analysis. In this case also, we only need to multiply $clog(n)$ by a constant factor to achieve reliability.

Gossip is extremely reliable. Once even a few nodes get the gossip, it is extremely hard to kill the gossip and it spreads very quickly. Failures may kill the gossip if the sender and the first order recipients all die without the second round happening, but the probability of such an event is extremely low considering random selection of nodes.

### Pull Based Gossip Analysis

In either the pull or push based methods, it takes about $log(n)$ time to reach half of the nodes in the system if we use a spanning tree with a fanout of constant degree. Now once half the nodes have received the gossip, pull is actually faster than push.
Say $p_i$ is the number of uninfected nodes in the system. Now in the next round, $p_{i+1} = {p_i}^{k+1}$ where k (k = b in our case) is the number of gossip targets. $p_{i+1}$ basically denotes the probability that a certain node is still uninfected after the $i+1$ round. This can happen only if this node was uninfected and the k nodes that it contacted were also uninfected, giving us our expression, which goes down super exponentially. So now the second half of the pull gossip protocol completes in $O(log(logn))$ which is very fast, but the overall algorithm is still $O(logn)$.

It is advantageous to use push in the first half and pull in the second half.

### Topology Awareness

Network topology is hierarchal in actual implementations and our Gossip protocol should take advantage of that property to reduce unnecessary load. For example say there are a number of server racks connected by a core switch and if the distribution probability is uniform for all nodes across all racks, the core switch will see a lot of traffic of the order $b*(n/x)$ where $x$ is the number of racks we have. This $O(N)$ traffic is very high.

We can optimise our algorithm by increasing the probability of nodes being selected in the same subnet and decreasing probability of nodes being selected in another subnet. Say you have $n_i$ nodes in your subset, you could select a node from outside your subnet with probability $1/(n_i)$ and a node in your own subnet with probability $(1-1/(n_i))$. Now the gossip will spread in a particular subnet in $O(log(n_i))$ time. Now once an entire subnet has been infected, everyone gossips outside the subnet with probability $1/(n_i)$, and there are $n_i$ gossiping, it takes $O(1)$ time for the gossip to go across the router to the other subnet, and someone to get infected and that subnet again gets infected in $O(logN)$ time.
